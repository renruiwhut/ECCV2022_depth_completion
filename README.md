# Baseline code for RGBD fusion

## Training Step1
To run the training step1:

```
sh train.sh 
```

## Training Step2
To run the training step2:

```
sh train_step2.sh 
```

## Testing Step1
To run the testing of the step1:

```
sh test.sh 
```

## Testing Step2
To run the testing of the step2:

```
sh test_step2.sh 
```
We provide the pretrained models in pretrained/model_00099.pt and pretrained/model_step2_00100.pt, so we recommend you to run test_step2.sh directly to get the final outputs.
